# Getting Started with Your Portfolio Repository

## üéØ Welcome to Your Professional Portfolio!

This repository is now set up as a comprehensive showcase of your development skills. Here's how to get started building your portfolio projects.

## üìã Next Steps

### 1. Initialize Git Repository
```bash
cd /Users/brandanlewis/blewis-maker-home
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial portfolio setup with project structure and documentation"
```

### 2. Connect to GitHub
```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/blewis-maker/blewis-maker-home.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Start Your First Project

I recommend starting with the **Django E-Commerce Platform** as it's highly sought after by employers:

```bash
cd projects/django-ecommerce

# Create a new Django project
django-admin startproject ecommerce .

# Create your first app
python manage.py startapp accounts
```

## üöÄ Development Workflow

### Daily Workflow
1. **Morning**: Review `Claude.md` for current objectives
2. **Development**: Work on assigned project features
3. **Testing**: Write and run tests for new features
4. **Documentation**: Update README files and code comments
5. **Evening**: Commit changes with descriptive messages

### Weekly Workflow
1. **Monday**: Plan week's objectives and create GitHub issues
2. **Wednesday**: Mid-week review and progress check
3. **Friday**: Complete features, update documentation, prepare for next week
